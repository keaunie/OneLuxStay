    <h2 class="tach2">What if a Guest Needs to Cancel Because of an Emergency?</h2>
    <p>We may be able to issue a refund if a guest has to cancel because of an emergency.</p>

    <h2 class="tach2">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This Extenuating Circumstances Policy explains how cancellations are handled when unforeseen events beyond your
        control arise after booking and make it impracticable or illegal to complete your reservation. This Policy
        applies to reservations for both accommodations and Experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        When this Policy allows for cancellation, it controls and takes precedence over the reservation’s cancellation
        policy. Guests that are impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel their reservation and receive,
        depending on the circumstances, a cash refund, travel credit, and/or other consideration. Hosts that are
        impacted by an event covered by this Policy can cancel without adverse consequences, but, depending on the
        circumstances, their calendars may be blocked for the dates of the cancelled reservation.

    </p>

    <h2 class="tach2">What Events are Covered</h2>
    <p>
        This Policy uses the term “Event” to refer to the following situations that occur after booking, are unforeseen
        at the time of booking, and prevent or legally prohibit completion of the reservation.
    </p>

    <p>Changes to government travel requirements. Unexpected changes to visa or passport requirements imposed by a
        governmental agency that prevent travel to the destination. This doesn’t include lost or expired travel
        documents or other personal circumstances relating to a guest’s authorization to travel.
    </p>
    <p>Declared emergencies and epidemics. Government declared local or national emergencies, epidemics, pandemics, and
        public health emergencies. This does not include diseases that are endemic or commonly associated with an
        area—for example, malaria in Thailand or dengue fever in Hawaii.
    </p>
    <p>Government travel restrictions. Travel restrictions imposed by a governmental agency that prevent or prohibit
        traveling to, staying at, or returning from the Listing location. This does not include non-binding travel
        advisories and similar government guidance.
    </p>
    <p>Military actions and other hostilities. Acts of war, hostilities, invasions, civil war, terrorism, explosions,
        bombings, rebellions, riots, insurrection, civil disorder, and civil unrest.
    </p>
    <p>Natural disasters. Natural disasters, acts of God, large-scale outages of essential utilities, volcanic
        eruptions, tsunamis, and other severe and abnormal weather events. This does not include weather or natural
        conditions that are common enough to be foreseeable in that location—for example, hurricanes occurring during
        hurricane season in Florida.
    </p>




    <h2 class="tach2">What is Not Covered</h2>
    <p>
        Everything else. This Policy only allows for cancellations for the Events described above. Everything else is
        excluded. Examples of situations that this Policy does not allow cancellations for include: unexpected disease,
        illness, or injury; government obligations like jury duty, court appearances or military duties; travel
        advisories or other government guidance (that fall short of a travel ban or prohibition); cancellation or
        rescheduling of an event for which the reservation was made; and transportation disruptions unrelated to a
        covered Event like road closures, as well as flight, train, bus and ferry cancellations. If you cancel a
        reservation in these cases, the amount refunded will be determined by the cancellation policy that applies to
        the reservation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tach2">What to do Next</h2>
    <p>
        If we notify you or publish information confirming that this Policy applies to your reservation, please follow
        the cancellation instructions that we provide. When we have notified you or published information about how this
        Policy applies, you should have the option to cancel under this Policy by going to your Trips page and canceling
        the impacted reservation. If you believe this Policy applies to your reservation, but we have not notified you
        or published information about the Event, please contact us to cancel your reservation. In all cases, you should
        be prepared to provide documentation that shows how the Event has impacted you or your reservation.
        <br>
        <br>
        if you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other things to be aware of: This Policy applies to all reservations with a check-in date on or after the
        effective date. This Policy doesn't apply to Luxe reservations, which are subject to a separate Luxe Guest
        Refund Policy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tach2">How Long Does it Take to Get a Refund</h2>
    <p>
        We send refunds immediately upon cancellation and they usually show up within 3-5 days, but sometimes it takes
        as long as 15 days before they reflect on the original payment method. In some countries, such as Brazil and
        India, it can take up to 2 months for the refund to arrive.
    </p>

    <h2 class="tach2">What if I'm Not Sure What My Reservation's Cancellation Policy Is or The Policy Doesn't Appear
        Here?</h2>
    <p>
        We occasionally let hosts try new policies that we’re testing. Always refer to your reservation
        details—accessible for the cancellation policy that applies to your particular stay.
